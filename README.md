# byecuadorians

**byecuadorians** is a platform showcasing the stories of Ecuadorians making an impact around the world. The project is built using a headless WordPress CMS as the backend and a modern **Next.js** frontend. As the platform grows, we plan to introduce microservices to handle user authentication, real-time messaging, notifications, and more.

## Project Structure

This repository follows a modular architecture, enabling easy scaling and the introduction of new features. The current structure includes:

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Headless WordPress (CMS) with REST API
- **Microservices:** Node.js (for services like authentication and messaging)
- **API Gateway:** (Optional) Node.js or similar to aggregate and route API requests
- **Database:** (To be determined based on services)
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (for chat service)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm** (or **Yarn**) installed.
2. A **WordPress** instance for the headless CMS. Follow the [WordPress installation guide](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) if you don't have one.
